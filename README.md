# React Native Learning Project

This repository is a learning project aimed at exploring and understanding React Native. Through this project, I have familiarized myself with the fundamentals of React Native, including navigation, state management, API calls, and running the project on simulators.

## Project Overview

The project demonstrates the following key features:

- **React Navigation**: Implemented using `@react-navigation/native` and `@react-navigation/native-stack` for screen transitions.
- **State Management**: Managed state using React's built-in `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.
- **API Integration**: Utilized `axios` to fetch data from a mock API.
- **Component Styling**: Styled components using `StyleSheet` from `react-native`.
- **Simulators**: Gained experience running and testing the app on iOS and Android simulators.
